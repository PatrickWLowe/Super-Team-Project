## Description
#### This is going to be an app that tracks your daily nutritional intake.
#### You will use the search bar tied to an API, connected to a database of nutritional facts. You will add your food and its weight to the search bar and receive nutritional facts based on the food type and weight. This info will then be logged to the local storage. Then the data will be compiled into a list of your daily nutritional intake based on calories, vitamins, etc. We will also incorporate an API tied to photos or gifs to produce images of the food searched to provide a more visually appealing ascetic.
#
